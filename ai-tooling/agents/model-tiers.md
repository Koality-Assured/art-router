# Agent model tiers

Orchestrators pick a reasoning tier and a **platform-native** model when spawning specialists. Default is **standard** unless the human specified another tier.

## Tiers

| Tier | Reasoning | Host examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fast` | low | cheapest fastest model on that host |
| `standard` | mid | GPT Luna; Cursor Grok 4.5; Gemini 3.7 Flash |
| `high` | high | GPT Terra; Cursor Grok 4.6; Gemini 3.7 Flash |
| `max` | max | GPT Sol; Cursor Grok 4.6; Gemini 3.1 Pro |

## Platform-native selection

The orchestrator selects the column for the **current host** and never defaults to another vendor's model on a host that has first-party models. Cursor → Cursor models (never default GPT/Claude on Cursor). ChatGPT/Codex → GPT models. Antigravity → Gemini models.

Product names in the table are the human-facing map. Host picker IDs change and are host-local operational data; do not persist them in cross-host canonical contracts.

New agents get `model_tier: standard` unless the human specifies otherwise.
